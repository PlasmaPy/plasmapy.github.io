# PlasmaPy 0.6.0

We're really happy to announce that we've just released [PlasmaPy version
0.6.0](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/whatsnew/0.6.0.html)!

We'd like to thank the wonderful people who have contributed to this release:

* Anthony Vo
* Dhawal Modi *
* Dominik Stańczak
* Drozdov David *
* Erik Everson
* Kevin Montes *
* Nick Murphy
* Peter Heuer
* Ramiz Qudsi
* Tiger Du

Where a * indicates their first contribution to PlasmaPy.

Note also that **this release drops Python 3.6 support**; we now
require Python 3.7, following NumPy's [NEP
29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html).

# The cool new features

Note: these are my (Dominik's) personal highlights. There's more, but these make the
prettiest plots right now.

## Two-fluid dispersion relations

</center>

In [PR #932](https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/932) Ramiz Qudsi
implemented P. M. Bellan's 2012 full two-fluid dispersion relation for any
electron-ion system. Take a look at [the notebook introducing
that](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/notebooks/dispersion/two_fluid_dispersion.html).

## Proton radiography

</center>

Peter Heuer designed and implemented a framework for synthetic proton
radiography. This is a multi-PR tour de force that simulates particles moving
through EM fields and hitting a detector plane, generating histograms such as
the above. I'd point you to the notebook on that, but [there's three right
now](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/examples.html#analyses-diagnostics).

## Analysis & Diagnostic framework; Langmuir probes

<center>
[![Langmuir probe sweep](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/_images/notebooks_analysis_swept_langmuir_find_floating_potential_21_0.png)](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/notebooks/analysis/swept_langmuir/find_floating_potential.html)
</center>

Erik Everson is spearheading work on our [analysis & diagnostic
framework](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/ad/index.html).  As the
first example, we've got a new and improved set of [tools for swept Langmuir
analysis](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/ad/index.html).

# What's next?

For this year, we're planning to have a roughly 3-month cadence for releases. Thus,
the next release is anticipated around mid June.

It should contain a refactored particle tracker, support for neoclassical
transport coefficient calculations for axisymmetric devices along with our
first forays into tools for fusion.

One final note: we're discussing transitioning to some form of [Calendar
Versioning](https://calver.org/). If you have thoughts on that, we'd be happy
to hear them!  Come join the discussion on [our Matrix
chatroom](https://app.element.io/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org).
