We have just released PlasmaPy v0.1.1, our first bugfix release which attempts to correct many of the flaws in our code we only noticed while releasing v0.1!

Take a look at the `release notes <http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/whatsnew/0.1.1.html>`_ to see what's changed.

As usual (although this is likely the first time you have reason to run this command), you should now be able to update via `pip install --upgrade plasmapy`.

Hot plasmas, and happy coding, everyone!
