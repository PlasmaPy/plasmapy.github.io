.. type: text

We are excited to announce the release of `PlasmaPy version 0.3.1
<http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/about/release_notes.html#version-0-3-1>`_.
This release includes two new subpackages: ``plasmapy.formulary``,
which consolidates much of the functionality that was formerly in
``plasmapy.physics``, ``plasmapy.mathematics``, and
``plasmapy.transport``; and ``plasmapy.simulation``, which contains
our particle tracker and will be the place to consolidate tools
related to plasma simulations.  These changes are part of an ongoing
plan to reorganize PlasmaPy's subpackage structure that will continue
in version 0.4.  In order to install PlasmaPy, please refer to the
`installation instructions <http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/install.html>`_
on `PlasmaPy's documentation page <http://docs.plasmapy.org/>`_.
