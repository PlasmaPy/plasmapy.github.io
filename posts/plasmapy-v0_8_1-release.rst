# PlasmaPy 0.8.1

We're excited to announce that we have just released [PlasmaPy
`v0.8.1`]!  This release drops Python 3.7 support, in accordance with the drop
schedule proposed in [NumPy Enhancement Proposal 29] for the scientific
Python ecosystem.

Some of the highlights from PlasmaPy `v0.8.1` are:

 - Lite-functions, which are simplified versions of formulary functions
   for performance-critical applications.

 - A fitting function for 1D spectra in the Thomson scattering diagnostic
   module.

 - New tools for the two-fluid dispersion relations.

 - A prototype of a magnetic null point finder.

 - A prototype plasma calculator for formulary functions that can be
   opened into your web browser.

 - Multiple new example notebooks.

 - Numerous improvements to the documentation infrastructure.

 - Numerous improvements to the package structure, in particular for
   continuous integration testing and the documentation. For example,
   hovering over most links to code objects will now open a preview
   window.

 - Adoption of the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct version 2.1.
