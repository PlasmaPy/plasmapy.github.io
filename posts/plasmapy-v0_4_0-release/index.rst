.. type: text

We are pleased to announce the release of `PlasmaPy version 0.4.0
<https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/whatsnew/0.4.0.html>`_.  This
release adds several new functions to ``plasmapy.formulary``, aliases
(with trailing underscores) for the most commonly used formulary
functions, classes to represent custom and dimensionless particles,
and a new module in ``plasmapy.diagnostics`` for Thomson scattering.
The ``plasmapy.atomic`` subpackage was renamed to
``plasmapy.particles`` as part of an ongoing plan to reorganize
PlasmaPy's subpackage structure.

In order to install PlasmaPy, please
refer to the `installation instructions
<http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/install.html>`_ on `PlasmaPy's
documentation page <http://docs.plasmapy.org/>`_.
