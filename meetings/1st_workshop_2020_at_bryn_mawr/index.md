        !! -- Workshop Cancelled
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the rapid development of COVID-19 (coronavirus) and out of an abundance
        of caution, the PlasmaPy workshop organizers have decided to cancel PlasmaPy's 
        first workshop.
    </p>
    <p>
        We originally intended to web-cast portions of the workshop, but with no 
        in-person attendees we feel this format would lead to a poor transmission of 
        ideas between PlasmaPy and its community.  At this time, it is crucial that 
        PlasmaPy fosters a strong community interaction to not only to convey its 
        goals and ambitions, but to receive vital feed back from our community.  
        <strong>Thus, we have decided to replace this workshop with a series of webinars
        and discussions to be held over the coming months.</strong>  As more information 
        on the series becomes available we will update the community.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for your continued support,<br>
        The PlasmaPy Workshop Organizers

### <a name="Overview"></a> Overview

PlasmaPy's first workshop, which is set up as a 3 day meeting for PlasmaPy developers and 
the PlasmaPy community. The first day (4/20) is designated for the PlasmaPy Team to 
discuss code development and project direction.  The remaining two days (4/21-4/22) are

PlasmaPy's roadmap, (2) inform the broader PlasmaPy community of PlasmaPy's objectives 
and direction, (3) demonstrate PlasmaPy's capabilities to the community, and (4) receive 
valuable feedback from the community.<br/><br/>
