In order to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by bringing together the
diversity of speakers and attendees and perspectives during this year's 
mini-conference, we plan to host two **post-meeting discussions**.  Here
we can continue the discussion on fostering the open-source community, bringing
in more members to our projects, organizing inter-project efforts, improving
package interoperability, etc.
