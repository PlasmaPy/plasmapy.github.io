# PlasmaPy "Office" Hours

Do you have a question about PlasmaPy?  Would you like to learn how to
become active in the PlasmaPy project?  Do you have an idea for a
great new feature or want to start an affiliated package?

If so, then **please join us for informal PlasmaPy "office" hours on
most Thursdays at 3 pm ET / 12 pm PT**.  We will meet on [Zoom].  The
schedule is published on our [calendar].  Any last minute changes will
be posted on our [Matrix chat].

In the summer of 2023, we will not hold office hours on June 8, 15, &
29 or July 13 & 27.

We will not hold office hours on [federal holidays] in the US, the
last two Thursdays of December, the first Thursday in January, or
during the [APS DPP meeting].

PlasmaPy developers can be reached at other times via the [Matrix
chat], in particular if the time for "office" hours does not work for
you.
