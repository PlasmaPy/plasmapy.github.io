PlasmaPy's charter includes promoting open source software for all of
the plasma community, and not just PlasmaPy. The entire community
benefits when there are multiple efforts trying to build functionality for all
aspects of the plasma field. As such, we want to promote any ongoing effort. This
page displays projects that have requested to be shown. If you want your
project include, and increase its visibility, then please submit a request
to <team@plasmapy.org>.

All projects/packages are considered **Community Packages**
<span style="vertical-align: 2px">{{% community_shield %}}</span>, but packages designed with
PlasmaPy interoperability are marked as **Affiliated Packages**
<span style="vertical-align: 2px">{{% affiliated_shield %}}</span>.
