# Contributing to PlasmaPy

There are numerous ways to contribute to PlasmaPy, including by
providing code and documentation, suggesting and discussing ideas,
submitting issues and bug reports, and engaging the broader plasma
physics community.  

**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not
ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at
all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source
projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code
isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's
trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can
help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the
project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution
process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as
a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see
the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

*This disclaimer was originally written by
[Adrienne Lowe](https://github.com/adriennefriend) for a
[PyCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo), and was adapted by 
[yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt) in their README file based on its use 
in the README file for the [MetPy project](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy).
It was then adapted by PlasmaPy.*

## Sharing ideas

There are several methods of communication that are being used in the
early stages of PlasmaPy development:

* [Signing up for the PlasmaPy email
  list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy) will allow
  you to participate in broader discussions and keep up with the
  latest developments.

* The [PlasmaPy repository on
  GitHub](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy) is the best place to
  [submit issues](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/issues) and
  review [pull requests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/pulls).

* The PlasmaPy [Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:matrix.org) or 
  [Gitter](https://gitter.im/PlasmaPy/Lobby) joint channel
  is a great place to have informal conversations, coordinate efforts,
  and share ideas.  
* We have biweekly telecons which are announced on the email list.

## Contributing code or documentation to PlasmaPy

If you see something you'd like to work on amongst our
[issues](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues), or if you've got
a great idea for something to include in the package, start hacking away on
that! However, please announce your intent first in the relevant issue (or make
one if necessary) to make sure there is no work duplication.

You can find most of what you should know in the [Contributing Guide](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/development/index.html).

Please note that PlasmaPy has a [Code of Conduct](/conduct).

Issues marked by the community as *help wanted* mean just that - either they're
good contributions for outsiders or there's an issue in the ongoing work that
requires a second opinion. Please consider these first!
