# Contributing to PlasmaPy

There are numerous ways to contribute to PlasmaPy, including by
providing code and documentation, suggesting and discussing ideas,
submitting issues and bug reports, and engaging the broader plasma
physics community.

## Sharing ideas

There are several methods of communication that are being used in the
early stages of PlasmaPy development:

* [Signing up for the PlasmaPy email
  list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy) will allow
  you to participate in broader discussions and keep up with the
  latest developments.

* The [PlasmaPy repository on
  GitHub](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy) is the best place to
  [submit issues](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/issues) and
  review [pull requests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/pulls).

* We have biweekly telecons which are announced on the email list.

## Contributing code or documentation to PlasmaPy

If you see something you'd like to work on amongst our
[issues](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues), or if you've got
a great idea for something to include in the package, start hacking away on
that! However, please announce your intent first in the relevant issue (or make
one if necessary) to make sure there is no work duplication.

You can find most of what you should know in the [Contributing Guide](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html).

Please note that PlasmaPy has a [Code of Conduct](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).

Issues marked by the community as *help wanted* mean just that - either they're
good contributions for outsiders or there's an issue in the ongoing work that
requires a second opinion. Please consider these first!
