# About PlasmaPy

The mission of the PlasmaPy Project is to foster the creation of a
fully open source software ecosystem for plasma research and
education. The [PlasmaPy core package] intends to be for plasma
science what [Astropy] is for astronomy — a collection of
functionality commonly used and shared between plasma physicists and
researchers globally, running within and leveraging the open source
scientific Python ecosystem.
