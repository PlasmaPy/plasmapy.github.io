# 62nd APS DPP - 11.04 Mini-Conference | Post-Meeting Discussions

### Growing an open-source software ecosystem for plasma science

**Day 1:** Tuesday, November 17th at 21 UTC / 4 pm EST / 1 pm PST <br/>
**Day 2:** Thursday, November 19th at 19 UTC / 2 pm EST / 11 am PST <br/>

In order to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by bringing together the
diversity of speakers and attendees and perspectives during this year's
mini-conference, we plan to host two **post-meeting discussions**. Here
we can continue the discussion on fostering the open-source community, bringing
in more members to our projects, organizing inter-project efforts, improving
package interoperability, etc.
