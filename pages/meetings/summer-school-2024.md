## Logistics

### Lodging

[Wayne Hotel]: https://waynehotel.com/directions/

All selected participants will be staying at the [Wayne Hotel] (139 East
Lancaster Avenue, Wayne, PA 19087), which is about 15 minutes from Bryn
Mawr College by car. Accommodations have already been arranged by the
College; when you arrive, participants will only need to provide their
name and that they are part of Bryn Mawr College's PlasmaPy school. You
may also be asked to provide a credit or debit card for incidentals —
the travel reimbursement will not include any charges to the room beyond
the nightly housing rate and taxes.

### Transportation

Bus transportation has been arranged between the [Wayne Hotel] and the
school location on Bryn Mawr's campus.

**A Bryn Mawr bus will leave from the hotel at 8:15 am every morning of
the workshop (Mon–Thurs) to take participants to campus and a return bus
to the hotel will leave at 6:40pm after dinner.**

If you miss the bus and need to take taxi or ride share transportation
to the campus/hotel, note that this cannot be reimbursed. Only arrival
and departure road transportation (i.e., to/from the airport) can be
reimbursed.

### Meals

There is breakfast available at the Wayne Hotel but there will also be
light continental breakfast and coffee provided before the beginning of
each day's sessions. Lunches will be at the on-campus dining hall which
is buffet style and typically can accommodate all dietary restrictions.
Dinners will be provided at Bryn Mawr College's on campus restaurant,
Wyndham House. Similarly a selection of menu items will be provided to
accommodate dietary restrictions.
