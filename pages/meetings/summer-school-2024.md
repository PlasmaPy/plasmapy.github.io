# PlasmaPy Summer School 2024

The PlasmaPy community is excited to announce its inaugural summer
school, which will be held from July 29 â€“ August 1, 2024 at
[Bryn Mawr College]. After introducing how to use PlasmaPy, this
workshop will help participants learn how to contribute to an open
source software project like PlasmaPy.

## Topics

We anticipate that the summer school will cover the following topics:

- Introducing `astropy.units`
- Using `plasmapy.particles` and `plasmapy.formulary`
- Using `git` ang GitHub
- Writing automated software tests
- Writing documentation
- PlasmaPy's code contribution workflow
- Tips for writing clean scientific software
- Psychological safety in code review

## Dates

Monday, July 29 to Thursday, August 1

## Location

The summer school will be held at [Bryn Mawr College] in Bryn Mawr,
Pennsylvania, USA (about a 30 minute drive from central Philadelphia).

### Schedule

Monday through Wednesday will include structured learning opportunities
and live tutorials. Thursday will be an optional unstructured day to
work alongside other participants and talk with PlasmaPy contributors
to apply the lessons learned earlier in the week.

### Application process

The application period for the summer school has now closed.

Thank you to everyone who applied! Due to the number of applications,
we expect to notify applicants if their application is accepted in the
week of June 3.
