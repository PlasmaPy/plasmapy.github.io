# PlasmaPy "Office" Hours

Do you have a question about PlasmaPy?  Would you like to learn how to
become active in the PlasmaPy project?  Do you have an idea for a
great new feature or want to start an affiliated package?

If so, then **please join us for informal PlasmaPy "office" hours on
most Thursdays at 3 pm ET / 12 pm PT**.  We will meet on [Zoom].  Any
last minute changes will be discussed in PlasmaPy's [chat room].

We do not expect to hold office hours on June 23, July 14, October 20,
November 24, December 22, and December 29 in 2022.

The [chat room] can be used to reach PlasmaPy developers at other
times, in particular if the time for "office" hours does not work for
you.
