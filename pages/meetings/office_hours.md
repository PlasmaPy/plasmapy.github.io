# PlasmaPy "Office" Hours

Do you have a question about PlasmaPy?  Would you like to learn how to
become active in the PlasmaPy project?  Do you have an idea for a great
new feature or want to start an affiliated package?

If so, then **please join us for informal PlasmaPy "office" hours on
Thursdays at 2 pm ET / 11 am PT**.  We will meet using this 
[Zoom link].  Any last minute changes will be announced in PlasmaPy's 
[chat room].

The [chat room] can be used to reach PlasmaPy developers at other times,
in particular if the time for "office" hours does not work for you.
