# PlasmaPy "Office" Hours

<p style="color: var(--plasmapy-red)"><b>Note: We will not be holding office hours 
on 2020 December 24 or 2020 December 31, but will return to our regularly scheduled 
programming on 2021 January 7th.</b></p>

Do you have a question about PlasmaPy?  Would you like to learn how to
become active in the PlasmaPy project?  Do you have an idea for a great
new feature or want to start an affiliated package?

If so, then **please join us for informal PlasmaPy "office" hours on
Thursdays at 19 UTC (2 pm EST / 11 am PST)**.  We will meet using this 
[Zoom link].  Any last minute changes will be announced in PlasmaPy's 
[chat room].

The [chat room] can be used to reach PlasmaPy developers at other times,
in particular if the time for "office" hours does not work for you.
