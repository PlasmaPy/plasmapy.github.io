# PlasmaPy Office Hours

Do you have a question about PlasmaPy? Would you like to learn how to
become active in the PlasmaPy project? Do you have an idea for a great
new feature or want to start an affiliated package?

If so, then **please join us for informal PlasmaPy office hours on
most Thursdays from 3–3:45 pm ET (12–12:45 pm PT)**. We will meet on
[Zoom]. The schedule is published on our [calendar].

Office hours will not be held after April 24, 2025 due to the
conclusion of NSF award 1931388, unless new funding is awarded.

We will not hold office hours on [federal holidays] in the US, the
last two Thursdays of December, the first two Thursdays in January, or
during the [APS DPP meeting].

PlasmaPy developers can be reached at other times via the [Matrix
chat], in particular if the time for office hours does not work for
you.
