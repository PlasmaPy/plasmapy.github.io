The mission of the PlasmaPy Project is to foster the creation of an open
source [Python] ecosystem for plasma research and education.

## Install PlasmaPy

PlasmaPy may be installed from the command line using [pip]:

```bash
pip install plasmapy
```

**Note:** If you run into difficulty using `pip`, you may also try using
`pip3` or `python -m pip` or `python3 -m pip` as the command.

If you have a working installation of [conda], then you may install
PlasmaPy with:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge plasmapy
```

[PlasmaPy's documentation] contains more detailed [installation
instructions][installation instructions]. If you are unfamiliar with Python, please check out the
[Python] website.

## Learn PlasmaPy

[PlasmaPy's documentation] describes how to use PlasmaPy and includes a
[gallery of example notebooks].

## Get Help

We encourage you to ask questions on [GitHub Discussions] or to stop by
a PlasmaPy [community meeting].

## Contribute and Report Bugs

There are [many ways to contribute] to an open source project, including
making [feature requests], [submitting bug reports], and organizing
events. PlasmaPy's [**contributor guide**] covers [getting ready to
contribute][getting ready to contribute], the [code contribution workflow], [coding guidelines],
[writing tests], and [writing documentation].

## Acknowledgments

Development of PlasmaPy has been supported by the U.S. National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Smithsonian Institution,
NASA, and Google Summer of Code, with many contributions from the
broader plasma physics and open source communities.
